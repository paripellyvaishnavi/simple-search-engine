Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data.
Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data.
This model can then make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
